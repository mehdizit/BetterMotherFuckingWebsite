    	<h1>This is still a motherfucking website.</h1>

        <p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>

        <h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>

        <h4>7 fucking declarations.</h4>

        <p>That's how much <span class="d">CSS</span>  it took to turn that<a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" title="ici">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this</br> easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the</br> glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
     <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li> 
          <li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li> 
          <li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
          <li>The motherfucker's still accessible to every asshole that visits your</br> site</li>
          <li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>


        <h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>

        <p class="a">You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site.</br> Here's how.</p>


        <h2>Let it breathe</h2>

        <p class="b">Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming</br> they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults</br> are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy.</br> Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>


        <p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a</br> book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>

        <h2>A little less contrast</h2>

        <p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life?</br> Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's</br> background a nice <span class="e">#EEEEEE</span> if I wasn't so focused on keeping</br> declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.
        </p>

        <h2>Size Matters</h2>

        <p>I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy</br> to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not</br> the screen.</p>

        <h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>

        <p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a </br>line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80</br> and users might actually read more than one sentence of your</br> worthless dribble.</p>

        <h3>Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>


        <p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" title="ici">this site's inspiration did.</a> What I'm saying is</br> that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken</br> by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but</br> they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there</br> need to make them not total shit.</br>
